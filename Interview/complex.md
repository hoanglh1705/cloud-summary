Here's the translation of your answer into English for an interview setting:

For me, the most complex system I've worked on was a **payment service**. In this system, we used the **Strategy Design Pattern** along with the **Factory Design Pattern**. For each type of transaction, we configured the steps it would go through and which systems it would interact with next. All of this was configurable, and we used a **queueing system** to improve scalability and reduce latency.

By using a **queueing system**, we also implemented a **health check mechanism** to ensure that consumers were still functioning properly, helping to avoid issues such as queue backlogs.
